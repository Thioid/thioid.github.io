							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>&emsp;I've broken too many phones. As a middle schooler, and even right now, I've dropped my phone more times 
								than I could count. However, after breaking my screen, my dad, understandably, didn't want to pay for a repair. 
								So, after watching multiple tutorials on how to fix a phone screen, I became confident and ended up buying a 
								screen replacement and some tools, and then I fixed it entirely by myself.</p>
								
							<p>&emsp;With this new skill I had, I realized I could keep learning more and more about technology while being paid- 
								so I learned how to fix multiple different iPhone models, iPads, androids, tablets, and watches, and started 
								a small Facebook page where I advertised my services. This taught me much about the difficulties of business.</p>
								
							<p>&emsp;Afterward, I started working at a local fast-food restaurant, eventually being promoted to a Managerial 
								position. I also worked with another manager to set up a POS system (Point of Sale system) to manage the 
								daily transactions and also set up a website, optimizing the SEO keywords which led to over ten thousand visits.</p>
								
							<p>&emsp;With this problem-solving skillset and my fascination with business, I decided to pursue a Bachelor's of 
								Science in Economics at The University of Texas at Austin. I find that this degree is a good mix of my interest 
								in economic principles and also with software, with my certificate being the Scientific Computation and Data 
								Science certificate. I find that programming is one of the best ways to see my own progress in solving problems, 
								so I naturally picked it up in some of my classes and I now have Python, C#, and R under my belt.</p>
								
							<p>&emsp;When not reading articles about current economics or coding, I love to read comics, read simple fiction 
								books, work out, and hang out with friends. I hope to pursue a career in financial/data analysis, data 
								science, or software engineering.</p>

						<h2>Astronomical!</h2>
						<p>Project is a simple game that I created using the C# coding language and the Unity software. 
							I created all the animations and art using Piskel. It utilizes many functions of Unity, including 
							game scripting, collision functions, position functions, sprite rendering, canvas functions, and more. 
							Utilized WebGL, a JavaScript API, to allow this game to be rendered and played online.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Amazon Web Scraper and Notifier</h2>
							<p>Project is a simple Amazon web scraper and notifier using the Python3 coding language. It utilizes many 
								packages to scan and pull data from an Amazon webpage, interpret it, and then send the user an email notification 
								if the item has fallen into the price they would want to purchase it at. I actually used this program to track the 
								price of Airpods and bought them when they fell below the price I wanted! Utilized the "requests" Python package 
								to pull the webpage into an HTML format. Utilized the "smtplib" Python package to be able to send an email if 
								needed. Utilized the "time" and "datetime" Python packages to set a daily timer that will check and scan the webpage 
								for any price changes. Utilized the "BeautifulSoup" Python library to pull data from the HTML and then use it.</p>

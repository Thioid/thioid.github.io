							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>&emsp;First off, I'd like to thank you for visiting my website! As stated above, my name is Isaak Cuevas and
								I am a junior at UT studying Economics. With this degree, I am pursuing a career in the
								finance industry.</p>
							<p>&emsp;I love to work on creative solutions to problems that I have, making projects that help me.</p>
							<p>&emsp;Recently, I made a Python program that utilizes the Yahoo Finance API to analyze over 500 stock market tickers, 
								generating options data for each ticker, based on the chosen expiration date. It analyzes and calculates the 
								return on investment by comparing each stock’s call contract’s value to the underlying stock’s price and then 
								ranks the call option contracts by the return on investment.</p>
							<p>&emsp;Thank you so much for taking the time to learn more about me! I would love to learn more about you or even
								just talk about similar interests, which is listed at the bottom of my resume.</p>
							<p>&emsp;Please contact me at igc359@gmail.com and take a look at my resume, which is linked at the bottom of 
								this page.</p>
